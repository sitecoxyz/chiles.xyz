Chiles.xyz is a site for pepper lovers.

We love growing, cooking, and of course eating all kinds of chile peppers.

With so many varieties and so many vendors we found it hard to keep track of everything.  Our response was to create chiles.xyz, a place where you can get all the relevant information in one place as well as stay up to date on the top reputable vendors of chile pepper seeds, dried chiles, and chili pepper products.
