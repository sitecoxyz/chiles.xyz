Often pickled, these mild peppers can be quite sweet with a touch of heat.  With the seeds removed, heat is very low.

This is a relatively new type of pepper, first discovered and bred in South Africa.  The exact parents are not known but it is thought that the variety is probably a stable habanero mutation.

While stabilizing this variety selection criteria were high yield, color, taste, and quality of the fruit.

Peppadews can often look like cherry tomatoes but tend to be more heartshaped than round.

This plant has white flowers with green inner corolla.  Fruits start green, turning red as they mature.
